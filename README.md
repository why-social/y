## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/dit342/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

𝕐 is a social media platform where users share short posts, containing text and optionally images. It can be used for sharing thoughts and media (images). People follow each other to see posts in their feed, and can like, repost, or reply to posts to engage in discussions.

### Pages

* **Feed:** The feed will be the start page of our application. It allows the user to view posts from accounts they follow. Every post can be liked, commented, or reposted, as well as opened to view all comments (see *Post* page). 

* **Post:** When an individual post is opened, the post’s content is shown at the top of the page, followed by the comment thread. Each comment can be replied to and liked. If a comment has replies, ‘view replies’ button appears under the comment. If the user is viewing their own post, they can edit and delete the post.

* **Profile:** On this page a user can view any profile on the platform, whether it's someone else’s or their own. At the top of the page the user’s information (such as name, profile picture, about section, etc.) is displayed. If the user is viewing their own profile, they can edit their information. Below the info section, the user’s posts, as well as re-posts, are put into a feed in chronological order (newest first). The profile feed has the same functionality as the home feed (liking, commenting, reposting). The user can also follow another user on this page.

* **Login/Registration:** A page for login and registration of the user. Users will be able to login using their username and password. To register a new user will need to fill out their username, password, name and birthday.

**NOTE:** On every page there will be a *persistent search bar* that allows user to search for other users.

## Advanced Feature
  Our advanced feature is feed generation. Each user will have a personalized feed generated based on their followings, accessible on the homepage under ‘Feed’ tab. The feed is composed on the server side. On the backend, the feature has its own endpoint (‘api/v1/feeds’) that returns the most recent posts from people you are following, sorted chronologically. Furthermore, the endpoint also supports descendent sorting and pagination.

  On frontend, the feed is the central part of the website, infinitely scrollable, without the need for users to switch pages manually. More data provided through HATEOAS queries is loaded once the user reaches the end of the scrollable list. With this, loading is more efficient for larger lists, as the client requests only parts of the feed, not the whole. 

  Additionally, alongside the ‘Feed’ tab, there is a ‘Recents’ tab providing fresh posts from all platform's users (followed or not) through the same infinite scrolling list functionality described above.
